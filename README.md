Welcome to the **Advanced Red Team Operations Toolkit** — a modular framework designed for professional red teamers and cyber security analysts working in multinational corporations (MNCs). This toolkit streamlines your workflow, integrates best-in-class tools, and enables real-time threat intelligence for modern enterprise environments.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Automated Reconnaissance:** Discover assets, enumerate subdomains, and perform OSINT with a single click.
- **Real-Time Vulnerability Scanning:** Stay updated with the latest threats using integrated feeds and vulnerability databases.
- **Exploitation Frameworks:** Generate payloads, conduct phishing campaigns, and automate credential attacks with popular tools.
- **Post-Exploitation Modules:** Escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and map out lateral movement pathways.
- **Evidence & Reporting Automation:** Collect artifacts, build attack timelines, and export professional-grade reports.
- **Modular Plugins:** Easily add or remove modules for customized operations.
- **C2 Framework Integration:** Control operations via Cobalt Strike, Mythic, Sliver, and more.
- **Live Threat Intelligence:** Fetch up-to-date data from public and commercial feeds to inform decision-making.
